    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; border: solid black; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;">Hey guys. I have been a developer for quite a while now, but there WAS a problem with me. I kept using AI. Which is really bad. I mean, its really not fair for developers who tried really hard to make websites, games and etc and get nothing and developers who use gemini, chatgpt and more. So thats why, i decided to quit AI. i am officialy free from robots! i took some courses and lessons about coding and now i am a real developer. So ill share my whole developing career with you by the button below!</h2>
